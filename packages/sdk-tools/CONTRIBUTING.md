# `@stepkit/sdk-tools`

SDK tools for building a workflow SDK. This package is not necessary for building a StepKit-compatible SDK, but rather contains helpful utilities to avoid "reinventing the wheel" when creating a workflow SDK.

StepKit-compatible SDKs are free to only depend on `@stepkit/core` if they'd like.

## Testing

```sh
pnpm test
pnpm test:watch
pnpm type-check
```
