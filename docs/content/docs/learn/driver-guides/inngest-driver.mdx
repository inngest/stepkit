The Inngest driver turns your StepKit code into production-ready workflows.

<Callout>Recommended for production deployments and for a better local development experience using the Inngest Dev Server.</Callout>

![Inngest Dev Server - See every step execution in real-time](/content/docs/learn/driver-guides/inngest-driver/dev-server-demo-2025-01-15.gif)

The Inngest Dev Server gives you complete visibility into your workflows during development. Inspect, test, debug, and deploy workflows with confidence.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stepkit/inngest inngest
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { Client } from "@stepkit/inngest";
import { inngestify } from "@stepkit/inngest";
import { serve } from "inngest/next";
import { z } from "zod";

const client = new Client({ id: "my-app" });

const workflow = client.workflow(
  {
    id: "process-order",
    inputSchema: z.object({ orderId: z.string() }),
  },
  async ({ input }, step) => {
    const order = await step.run("fetch-order", async () => {
      return await db.orders.get(input.data.orderId);
    });
    
    await step.run("process-payment", async () => {
      return await processPayment(order);
    });
    
    // Inngest-specific: Send event to another workflow
    await step.ext.sendEvent("notify-warehouse", {
      name: "order.processed",
      data: { orderId: order.id },
    });
    
    return order;
  }
);

// Serve the StepKit workflow as a Nextjs API route
export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve(
  inngestify(client, [workflow])
);
```

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Unique identifier for your Inngest application. |
| `mode` | `"cloud" \| "dev"` | Defaults to `"cloud"`. Use `"dev"` for local development. |

## How it works

The Inngest driver translates StepKit workflows into Inngest functions. Each workflow runs on Inngest's infrastructure or DevServer, handling:

- Event routing and triggers
- State persistence across steps
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Observability and execution history
- Deployment and scaling

## Inngest-specific features

The Inngest driver extends StepKit with platform-specific capabilities:

### Send events between workflows

```typescript
await step.ext.sendEvent("trigger-another-workflow", {
  name: "order.completed",
  data: { orderId: "123" },
});
```

### Wait for external events

```typescript
const approval = await step.ext.waitForEvent("wait-for-approval", {
  event: "document.approved",
  timeout: "7d",
});
```

See [Inngest Driver Reference](/docs/reference/stepkit-inngest/inngest-driver) for complete API documentation.

## Development mode

Run Inngest locally during development:

```bash
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

```typescript
const client = new Client({ id: "my-app", mode: "dev" });
```

The Dev Server provides a local UI for testing and debugging workflows at `http://localhost:8288`.

## Deployment

Deploy workflows to Inngest by deploying your application. Inngest automatically discovers functions at your app's `/api/inngest` endpoint.

No additional configuration needed—just deploy your Next.js, Remix, or Express app.
