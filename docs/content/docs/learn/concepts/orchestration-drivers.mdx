title: Orchestration Drivers
---

Orchestration drivers handle the execution of your workflows. They manage state persistence, retries, and scheduling—the orchestration layer beneath your workflow code.

## Open by design

StepKit workflows aren't locked to a single platform. Write your workflow once, run it anywhere. Switch drivers to match your environment: local development, testing, or production deployment.

The same workflow code works across all drivers. Only the client initialization changes.

## Available Drivers

### Inngest Driver

Production-grade orchestration on the Inngest platform. Handles event-driven triggers, observability, retries, and deployment at scale. **Recommended for production.**

```typescript
import { InngestClient } from "@stepkit/inngest";

const client = new InngestClient({ id: "my-app" });
```

**Use for:** Production deployments, event-driven workflows, team collaboration

### In-Memory Driver

Runs workflows entirely in memory with no persistence. Perfect for **testing and development** when you need fast iteration without files or databases.

```typescript
import { InMemoryClient } from "@stepkit/local";

const client = new InMemoryClient();
```

**Use for:** Unit tests, integration tests, rapid prototyping

### Filesystem Driver

Stores workflow state on the local filesystem. Workflows survive restarts and you can inspect state files directly. Best for **local development** and learning how durable workflows work.

```typescript
import { FileSystemClient } from "@stepkit/local";

const client = new FileSystemClient({ baseDir: "./.stepkit" });
```

**Use for:** Local development, learning, debugging workflow state

## Choosing a driver

- **Getting started?** Use Inngest for the best development experience and production deployment
- **Building and testing?** In-Memory or Filesystem work great for local iteration
- **Need event triggers or long-running workflows?** Use Inngest

The driver is just infrastructure. Your workflow code stays the same.
